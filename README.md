This codes repository provides the pytorch implementation of the KGI virtual try-on method proposed in ICCV23 paper [Virtual Try-On with Garment-Pose Keypoints Guided Inpainting.](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/papers/Li_Virtual_Try-On_with_Pose-Garment_Keypoints_Guided_Inpainting_ICCV_2023_paper.pdf)

## Experimental Environment 
Please follow the steps below to build the environment and install the required packages.
```
conda create -n kgi python=3.8 -y
conda activate kgi
bash install_pkgs.sh
```

## Data Preparation
1. The VITON-HD dataset could be downloaded from [VITON-HD](https://www.dropbox.com/s/10bfat0kg4si1bu/zalando-hd-resized.zip?dl=0) . Please place the dataset under the directory `KGI/data/`. The dataset contains the following content:
   |Content|Comment|
   |-------|-------|
   |agnostic-mask|not in use in KGI|
   |agnostic-v3.2|not in use in KGI|
   |cloth ||
   |cloth-mask|not in use in KGI|
   |image||
   |image-densepose|not in use in KGI|

## Model Training
The model training of the KGI method consists of three steps: Training of the Keypoints Generator, Training of the Parse Generator, Training of the Semantic Conditioned Inpainting Model.
### Keypoints Generator
* The Keypoints Generator is trained with the following scripts:
   ```
   cd codes_kg
   python3 train_kg.py
   ```
  During the training, the visualization of some validation samples will be saved under directory `KGI/visualizations/two_graph_cs/`. Below is an example of visualization results.
  The pretrianed checkpoints of Keypoints Generator could be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FQbeWkcqgSqycznGW6INWt2kkrk5nG3H/view?usp=drive_link) and put under the directory `KGI/checkpoints_pretrained/kg/`.
* Since the parse generation is based on the estimated keypoints conditions, please generate the keypoints conditions with the following scripts before the training of Parse Generator:
  ```
  bash generate_kg_demo_paired.sh
  bash generate_kg_demo_unpaired.sh
  bash generate_kg_train.sh
  bash generate_kg_test_paired.sh
  bash generate_kg_test_unpaired.sh
  ```
  The generated keypoints conditions will be saved under the directory `KGI/example/generate_kg/` and also could be downloaded from [train_kg_conditions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Fpte42AvLOgnXtaiND9J3K2Q9DpIsLQe/view?usp=drive_link) and [test_kg_conditions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JAmDUJRYFvSsIperVtvWqIjdod6loruM/view?usp=drive_link). The files should be placed under the directories `KGI/data/zalando-hd-resized/train/` and `KGI/data/zalando-hd-resized/test/`, respectively.
### Parse Generator
* The Parse Generator is trained with the following scripts:
  ```
  cd codes_pg
  python3 train_pg.py
  ```
  During the training, the visualization of some validation samples will be saved under directory `KGI/visualizations/parse_full/`. Below is an example of visualization results.
  The pretrianed checkpoints of Parse Generator could be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_2lTeLdCczBnnaXsMxBtvbLZv2GY3PCp/view?usp=drive_link) and put under the directory `KGI/checkpoints_pretrained/pg/`.
* After the training of the Parse Generator, the person image parse (estimated segmentation map) could be generated with the following scripts:
  ```
  bash generate_pg_demo_paired.sh
  bash generate_pg_demo_unpaired.sh
  bash generate_pg_test_paired.sh
  bash generate_pg_test_unpaired.sh
  ```
  The generated parse conditions will be saved under the directory `KGI/example/generate_pg/` and also could be downloaded from [test_pg_conditions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Zq-v9BzyxOM_b_1EKQNz0ks8vF-ixpyw/view?usp=drive_link). The files should be placed under the directory `KGI/data/zalando-hd-resized/test/` for tps conditions and final results generation. 
### Semantic Conditioned Inpainting Model
* The Semantic Conditioned Inpainting Model is trained with the following scripts:
  ```
  cd codes_sdm
  python3 train_sdm.py
  ```
  The pretrianed checkpoints of Semantic Conditioned Inpainting Model could be downloaded from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1guxm63mRMH64xiycDHsEqNb_q3KqueDB/view?usp=drive_link) and put under the directory `KGI/checkpoints_pretrained/sci/ckpt_1024/`.
* The tps conditions (recomposed person image and content keeping mask) could be generated with the following scripts:
  ```
  cd codes_tps
  bash generate_tps_demo_paired.sh
  bash generate_tps_demo_unpaired.sh
  bash generate_tps_test_paired.sh
  bash generate_tps_test_unpaired.sh
  ```
  The generated tps conditions will be saved under the directory `KGI/example/generate_tps/` and also could be downloaded from [test_tps_conditions](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JGYukLDJOXRkLmCrddzCJJbcIQhTVFIp/view?usp=drive_link). The files should be placed under the directory `KGI/data/zalando-hd-resized/test/` for final results generation with semantic conditioned inpainting.
* With the trained Semantic Conditioned Inpainting Model and tps conditions, the final results could be generated with the following scripts:
  ```
  cd codes_sci
  bash generate_sci_demo_paired.sh
  bash generate_sci_demo_unpaired.sh
  bash generate_sci_test_paired.sh
  bash generate_sci_test_unpaired.sh
  ```
## Demo with Pretrained Model
   With the pretrained models, the final try-on results and the visualizations of the intermediate results could be generated with the following demo scripts:
   ```
   python3 generate_demo.py
   ```
   The final try-on results will be saved under `KGI/example/generate_demo/final_results/` and the visualizations of the intermediate results will be saved under `KGI/example/generate_demo/vis/`. Below is an example of demo results.
